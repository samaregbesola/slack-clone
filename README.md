## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup

- [React](https://reactjs.org)


## What I learnt
- I learnt how to use JIT mode in tailwind.
- With this project, I learnt how to setup netlify build for continous deployment.
- The project also helped to broaden my knowledge of responsive designs.


## Available Scripts

To run locally, clone or download and run the command.
```sh
npm install
```

In the project directory, you can run:
```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Continued Deployment

If I had time, I'll implement the search feature and create a route for the respective pages.
